 Below is a sample output result for the given input format information in the instruction sheet
 with 5 lines and 2 pairs of points to compare the region in. I did add one more pair of point 
 to check in a case where the pair are not in the same region since the two sample pairs in the 
 instructions were both in the same region.  
 
Write the number of lines:
5
Type in line coordinates by 'x1 y1 x2 y2' structure
0.00 0.12 0.23 1.00
1.00 0.41 0.00 0.52
1.00 0.20 0.30 1.00
0.00 0.40 0.10 0.00
1.00 0.35 0.10 1.00
Input pairs of points to be tested by 'x1 y1 x2 y2' structure. To stop write 'done'.
0.25 0.80 0.60 0.50
The points are in the same region.
0.95 0.10 0.11 0.50
The points are in the same region.
0.25 0.80 0.11 0.50
The points aren't in the same region.
done
Number of External Nodes in Tree: 10
External Path Length: 40.0
Average Path Length: 4.0

Using the input from SAMPLE text file 

Write the number of lines:
3

0.00 0.24 0.68 0.02
1.00 0.42 0.00 0.82
1.00 0.40 0.10 1.00
Input pairs of points to be tested by 'x1 y1 x2 y2' structure. To stop write 'done'.
0.24 0.80 0.10 0.97
The points are in the same region.
0.95 0.78 0.24 0.46
The points aren't in the same region.
done
Number of External Nodes in Tree: 4
External Path Length: 13.0
